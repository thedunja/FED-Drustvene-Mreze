It's not intuitive per a skeuomorphic match to real world solution, 'bunny forward, right, repeat'... The 'best' solutions aren't based on most efficient moves, rather just the number of code items, and often include 'wasted' moves, loops, or 'errors' (the bunny keeps jumping but is blocked or would have jumped to his death off the board).
